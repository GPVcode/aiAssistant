First I hooked up Chat Engine into my React app and customize the header and message form.
In header, I set up CSS using SASS and brought in heroicons for pleasant interface.
I coded the header to show the chatrooms title and made the chatroom description to dynamically show date and time, otherwise, it would say that there is no chatroom selected
